            "text":"Once upon a time an angel held my hand. She wiped away my tears and helped me understand Our time on Earth is brief; there are lessons to be learned. Each precious day God gives us, another page is turned. Every chapter full of memories, times of joy and tears, Triumphs and defeats, through every passing year. She loved us unconditionally, always by our side. When no one else would listen, in her we could confide. With gentle words of wisdom, she led us on our way, Down the paths of righteousness if ever we did stray. She saw the light in everyone and gave with no regrets, Always from her heart, let's not forget."
